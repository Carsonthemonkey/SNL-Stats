# Basic Data collection

For our first pass at collecting data, we want the following data points for a bunch of SNL skits probably in a `.csv` file. We can gather some of this data by scraping the [SNL archive](http://www.snlarchives.net/):

- Video ID (Youtube)
- Title
- Length
- View Count
- Like Count
- Comment count
- Upload Date


# More Data collection

- Episode (Can be N/A if exact episode cannot be determined)
- Episode ID (SNL archive)
- Actors in the sketch
- Comment sentiment
- Transcript analysis
